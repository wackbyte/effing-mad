//! A demonstration of the effects! and handler! macros, which allow you to group effects into one
//! type, and use one handler for all of them. The primary benefit of this is that this handler can
//! own or mutably borrow some data, and that data can be accessed by all of the arms of the
//! handler.
//! Here we use State as a classic (and generic!) example of an effect. The same program could just
//! be written using a mutable variable, but that's no fun.
