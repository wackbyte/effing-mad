//! This library brings typed effects to Rust in a flexible and composable way. By building on
//! [`Generator`]s, effectful computations can be expressed in a way that allows arbitrary and
//! swappable behaviour - any handler of the correct type can be applied to a computation, meaning
//! different semantics of effects can be selected at each call site of an effectful function.
//!
//! ## Glossary
//! - effectful computation: an in-progress computation that uses effects. analogous to `Future`.
//! - effectful function: a function that returns an effectful computation. analogous to `async fn`.
//! - effect: you know, I'm actually not sure. I should ask one of my PL teachers. In this library
//! though, an effect is a value that can be passed out of an effectful computation and into an
//! effect handler, which produces another value to pass back in.
//! - injection: an `effing_mad` term referring to the value passed into a computation as a result of
//! it running an effect.
//! - "pure" function: a Rust function that does not use `effing_mad` effects. Rust is not a pure
//! language (crudely, Rust code can `println!()` whenever it wants) so these docs use quotes to
//! indicate this meaning as opposed to the real meaning of pure, where functions do not use side
//! effects.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//! Define an [`Effect`]. Now, you can define an [`#[effectful(â€¦)]`](effing_macros::effectful)
//! function that uses it. Once you call this function, its effects can be handled one by one with
//! [`handle`]. Handlers are "pure" Rust functions, but it's easiest to construct them using
//! [`handler!`](effing_macros::handler). Once all the effects have been handled away, a computation
//! can be driven with [`run`].
